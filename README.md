This repository for the Jetpack Compose [#AndroidDevChallenge](https://developer.android.com/dev-challenge). July 2022.

I Started this challenge on my tech community group in Gaza strip- Palestine to encourage me and other devs to start moving

I used the #AndroidDevChallenge template so that I could reactivate it and reach out to the maximum Devs in the world.
